# ultimate-DevOps-ci-cd-project
A complete end-to-end DevOps CI/CD learning project using AWS, Linux, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Grafana and more.

“I structured my DevOps learning into a public GitHub repository named ultimate-devops-ci-cd-project where I documented every step, mistake, fix, and implementation detail. This helped me understand Git workflows, documentation habits, and real-world DevOps project structure.”
